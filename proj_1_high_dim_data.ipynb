    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to show and apply three different techniques for dimensionality reduction of data that we want to classify with a quantum circuit. This is important, since nowadays NISQ devices can count on 50-100 noisy qubits at most. Therefore, encoding 1 dimension to 1 qubit is often unfeasible.\n",

    "Here we will be using the Winsconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which has the following features (see [sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html#sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer))\n",

    "In Part 1 of this notebook, we will reduce dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA) and then use the method of [Havlicek et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326). Here, one dimension of the reduced dataset will be encoded in 1 qubit. In Part 2, we will perform data dimensionality and classification together, by using the data re-uploading technique of [Perez-Salinas et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02085). Finally, Part 3 will use amplitude encoding as shown in [Mottonen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407010) to exponentially reduce data dimensionality, by encoding data in a quantum state."
